This file contains rules for all AI Coding agents to follow.

## Hard Roles

The following rules are considered HARD RULES. Under no circumstance may ANY AI agent, for ANY reason break them. If an agent cannot complete a task while adhering to these rules, the agent should not proceed, and instead respond with the rule that is blocking it.

DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE, BREAK ANY OF THE FOLLWING RULES:

- NEVER use the "as" keyword in TypeScript. Use of "as" is strictly prohibited.
- NEVER use the "function" keyword in JavaScript/TypeScript. All functions should be declared as arrow functions with "const" or "let".
